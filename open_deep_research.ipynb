        "This code defines a configuration system for a chatbot that generates reports. Here's a breakdown of its components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Default Report Structure:**  \n",
        "   A multi-line string provides a template for creating reports. It suggests starting with an introduction that gives an overview of the topic, then dividing the main content into sections focused on sub-topics, and finally ending with a conclusion that summarizes the main points.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Enumerated Types (Enums):**  \n",
        "   - **SearchAPI:** Lists possible search services (like PERPLEXITY, TAVILY, EXA, ARXIV, and PUBMED) that the chatbot might use to gather information.\n",
        "   - **PlannerProvider & WriterProvider:** These define options for external service providers that handle planning (organizing the report structure) and writing (generating the text). Options include providers like ANTHROPIC, OPENAI, and GROQ.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Configuration Data Class:**  \n",
        "   The `Configuration` class holds various settings for the chatbot. Key attributes include:\n",
        "   - **report_structure:** Uses the default report template.\n",
        "   - **number_of_queries:** Specifies how many search queries should be generated in each iteration (default is 2).\n",
        "   - **max_search_depth:** Sets the limit for how many times the chatbot can iterate through reflection and search (default is 2).\n",
        "   - **planner_provider & planner_model:** Determine which external service and model to use for planning the report.\n",
        "   - **writer_provider & writer_model:** Specify the external service and model for generating the report text.\n",
        "   - **search_api & search_api_config:** Indicate which search API to use (defaulting to TAVILY) and allow for additional API configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Configuration Initialization Method:**  \n",
        "   The class method `from_runnable_config` allows the configuration to be created from a provided configuration object (or from environment variables). It checks for values in the environment (using uppercase names) and from a passed configuration dictionary. Only fields with provided values are used to instantiate the `Configuration` object."
